Summer is that the perfect time to try and do so – it allows you to revamp your space before the upcoming holidays arrive.

And if you've got the other questions, be happy to offer our bath solutions experts a call.\n\n**1. CREATE A BUDGET**\n\nThe first and foremost thing you ought to do before renovating your bathroom is to establish a budget. There's always the prospect of a renovation bringing surprises, and it's better to be prepared than to spend quite you would like to.\n\n**2. GO GREEN**\n\nWhen you prefer to go green, the environment won't be the sole thing that benefits from it – you'll too. Environmentally friendly products not only look great, but they perform well, are better for your health, and may prevent money on your water and energy bills.\n\n**3. DON'T ATTEMPT TO DO EVERYTHING YOURSELF**\n\nYou may be a handy person, but if you're unacquainted with any stage of a toilet renovation, don't attempt to roll in the hay yourself; you'll find yourself causing more harm than good.\_\n\n**4. KEEP YOUR PLUMBING**\n\nWhile you'll be tempted to swap your sink and your toilet, you'll save tons of cash if you only keep them where they're. Moving plumbing fixtures can't only be a hassle, but it can quickly add up in cost.\n\n**5.

DON'T FORGET YOUR LIGHTING**\n\nYou don't want to finish up with a totally renovated bathroom paired with outdated lighting. Save the lighting task for last so you'll get a pity for your new bathroom. Then, consider all of your options, including ambient lighting, accent lighting, vanity lighting, and more.\n\n**7. TRY VERTICAL STORAGE**\n\nBathrooms usually aren't the most important rooms in your home, so cash in on the smaller space you've got and check out some vertical storage options. You'll use your space more wisely and open up your bathroom, so it's larger than it is.\n\n8\\*\\*. FIND A BOLD MIRROR\\*\\*\n\nIf your bathtub or sink isn't the toilet piece that creates a press release, find a bold mirror to feature some pizzazz. Mirrors also will make your bathroom look larger, so don't be afraid to experiment.\n\nFor conversions and new installations, trust BRAND NAME.
